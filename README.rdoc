This web application is a web add-on for the program for image processing by neural networks. Paintings are created using Convolutional Neural Networks and the Artistic Style Algorithm by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge. More details can be found on the GitHub link below.

This program presents web-service for algorithm combining the content of one image with the style of another image using convolutional neural networks.

==Requirements

Test with Rails 4.2


==Installation

For the web application to work, you need to create a config.secret in the config folder with approximately the following content:

---
token:
  production: - session key

workservers:
  server1:
    host: "deploy" - address of the remote server to be processed
    username: "deploy" - login
    password: "password"
    remote_neural_path: "/home/deploy/neural-style" - the path where the network is located
    init_params: "-gpu -1 -image_size 100" - network initialization string
    iteration_count: 10 - number of processing iterations
    admin_email: "admin_mail@gmail.com"


smtp_settings:
  address: 'smtp.gmail.com'
  port: 587
  domain: 'gmail.com'
  user_name: 'result_sending_mail@gmail.com'
  password: 'password'
  authentication: 'plain'
  enable_starttls_auto: true
